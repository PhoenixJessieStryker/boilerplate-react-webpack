                    <p>
                        I think its important to realise that sometimes your Goals are things that take alot more time than you realise 
                        . I had to move past that idea and see that some of the things i wanted to achieve for my website

                        <p> I Didnt Really meditate but i imagined i was using what they had told me.I think
                             it's really nice to see the Scientific Process and forwarding one that focus' better on yourself as a whole.

            <div class="col-4"><h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation? </h3>
                   <p>I guess the Nature of Meditation and the different aspects or ways you can manipulate
                        it to increase your focus to further benefit study or work habits
                   </p>

            <div class="col-4"> <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                <p> I Didnt midn the idea of active meditation and takign a few minute's to lie down per day 
                    which as i mentioned a while back reminded me of relaxing and reading a book a few moments
                     before class to unwind. It helps keep your level of focus ..or well maintain it at least

            <div class="col-4"> <h3>My Personal Musings</h3>
                <p> I really have to take into consideration to try meditationn a bit more , i seem to find myself only trying it when im told to in my assignments. 
                    it isnt something i would do on a regular basis.. For those who may have the same thoughts as me meditation doesnt have to be about folding your 
                    legs and relaxing and reflecting on your life and the enviroment around you . 
                    It can be as simple as going for a drive to somewhere you like most and staring down a sunset for example and using the time to clear your mind.

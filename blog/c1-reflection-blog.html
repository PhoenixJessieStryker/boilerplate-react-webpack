    <h1>My Cultural Reflection of Dev Academy</h1>
    <h3><u>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? </u> </h3>
    <p>To be honest, I wouldnt be the only one in saying im awfully excited to start my bootcamp, the more i start coding i begin to see the oppertunities that it can give.
        after working in prep i have been able to work with a few people so far and i already love the culture. I spoke to Rohan at the beginning of last year in hopes to start it then, but became hesistant and in alot of cases was worried about the money.
        I am really looking forward to building more relationships and furthering my knowledge :) .
    </p>
    <h3><u>What are your impressions?</u></h3>
    <p>as said above i look forward to expanding my boundaries in Web developement and not only this but also hoping to use what i take from here to give me a new resolve to start Robotics again.</p>
    <h3><u>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</u></h3>
    <p>From what ive noticed im not the only one who is new to the area of coding whether its github ,Javascript or CSS we are all approaching something new in some way and i hope to build a relationship with some students there.
        to others who may be already experienced i will try and work with what they have to say and ask alot of questions maybe giving them ideas they hadnt yet thought of.
    </p>
<h3><u>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</u></h3>
<p>Not entirely, However i did have the expectation of this being a class.. I had that view because i have only recently come from graduating college and it has been the way ive been taught for a while. I understand that it now relates to methods of independant study and a cojoin of working with others.

 </p>
<h3><u>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</u> </h3>
<p>most definately ,The idea to work in pairs to further our own learning as individuals iwll mean that i can bounce ideas as well and appat my mind set.</p>

<h3><u>Does it make you nervous?</u></h3>
    <p>
    "All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them." - Walt Disney 
    As it is okay to be nervous, I believe that its better to approach something with heart so that your able to give it your all. 
    This will be a challenging boot camp ahead and with alot of others around me we'll all be able to accomplish so much more.

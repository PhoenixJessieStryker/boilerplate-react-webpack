                            <h3> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3><br>
                            <p> I find JavaScript more Technical and alot more hand's on and getting you hands dirty kind of Technical. 
                                It is the bees knee and really keeps your head Deep in mathmatical Equations for Html or CSS.

                            <h3> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
                            <p> A loop is a Sequence performed in an order thats made by 'Parameters'. The Loop - Repeats until a certain condition is met or else it continues.
                                For example If you have a shower you wash up, if you have washed up dry yourself. If the Statements both become true then 
                                go ahead and grab a pair of nice clothes and wear them. The Loop is controlled my ' Control flow which directs the path in which the loop takes' 
                                this is from the first to last line. <br><br>

                                <h3> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
                                <p> An array Really just allows you to keep a Multitude of Data pieces in a single variable.  
                                    They are each assigned their own numerical value which starts at zero and can be used to recall them.
                                    Objects can hold multiple values as well, but their data is defined in pairs of a property
                                    name with a corresponding value and you access their data by their property name.<br><br>
                                </p>

                                <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                                <p> Functions are a Section of code similar to the Body tag of the HTML ;the relation being that they both 
                                    contain other lines of code within it. A Function contains a description and instructions of all the things you want it to do.  <br><br>

                            <h3>  What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3><br>
                            <p> I guess part of Mindfulness is your own focus and how to control that focus. In terms of Self Awareness, it allows you to have focus and control <br>
                                because you know yourself. You know why you are there, what you are feeling and if you know these things it becomes easier to control or change face 
                                to how you are feeling in a scenario. Mindfulness provides you with the stability, focus, and clarity to reflect upon yourself and see yourself open-mindedly and evaluate yourself. 
                                whether it's your values or morals you can really set out to understand why sometimes you may act out of line.

                            <h3>Body Scan - What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
                            <p> Definately Interesting i mean i have tried it before in order to relax and fall asleep easier and its calming adn relaxing but it isnt easy to 
                                shut off your mind with the snap of your fingers which si why they come up with techniques like counting sheep <br><br>

                                <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
                                <p> Emotions are simply what we feel and can affect how we run our daily life in beliefs still just like the sayign think positive and good things will happen.
                                   However i also understand the possesing the insight of being able to realise that our emotions do not alsways judge our decisions and a qoute from the book says 
                                   "one creates the possibility of change within oneself" <br><br>

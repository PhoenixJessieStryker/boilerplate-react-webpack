    <h1>Sprint 2.6 Assignment Q&A</h1>
 <ul> <div><h3> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3></div></ul>  
 <ul><h4><i>Html</i></h4></ul>
 <p>Think of Html as a Structual Language, For example :Builders refer to the building code or branz. 
     this is in order to see if things are correct in order to build according to plan..</p>
     <p>how does this relate?</p>
 <div><p>Well..Just like Plans for a Building or the Building code itself, Html Creates the Structure and Describes it.  </p></div>
 <p>For people with already a small knowledge of Code you would know this</p>
 <ul>
<p>Html - Foundation</p>
<p>Head - concept/Name of the Building</p>
<p>Body - Structure/Framing</p>
<p>Style _ well we could probably guess this one</p>
<div><p>But you get the idea right?.. which is why it is also important to keep your coding tidy.. just like how we would brush our teath in the morning!</p></div><p>Nobody wants to face something that smells or looks bad do they?..Possibly for some</p>
 </ul>

 <ul><h4><i>CSS</i></h4></ul>

 <p>CSS Describes how things are meant to be displayed or presented on screen once your webpage has been loaded ,this is the second core in technology for building web pages. </p>
 <p>just like how like having a home needs paint and artwork around a house a webpage needs its visual persona also. </p>
<p>I may or may not update this page later onward as i havent yet been able to code using CSS as of yet.</p>

<ul><h4><i>DOM</i></h4></ul>

<p>...And not just the name Dom short for Domonic.. Dom actually Stands for 'Document Object Model'  (D.O.M) </p>
<p>The Dom Actually Defines the Interface for the Program and the way the program can be accessed.</p>
<p>with a Dom Web Developers/Programmers can build their own Documents, Navigate through the Structure as well as add and modify or Delete elements and Content.
    <p>to anyone of my friends... This is easily Described as running through your computer and adding/deleting files, however this is on a newer scale dealing with much more complicated and stress dwelling outcomes.</p>
</p>


<ul> <div><h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3></div></ul>  
<p>Boxifying Design is splitting areas of your websites into it's own 'Box' for example</p>
<div><p>take a piece of paper with a websites homescreen on it and start cutting out set area's</p></div>
<p>For example</p>
<div><p>Cutting out the Head of the Design , the centre of the page and finally the bottom </p></div>
<p>Now identify what may be in those parts for example on a website there is a search bar usually available .. maybe an image</p>
<p>after identitying all these little details you start to see a pattern. You could actually keep cutting up all these features. </p>
    <p>You should have found or thought of at least 9-20 possible details that can be split into their own box</p>
   <p>This is called Boxifying</p>

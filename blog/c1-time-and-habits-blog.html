Whether it was taking what Carol Dwell had to say or using the counterintuitive tips in my own crazy but different way to learn 
      to learn.
    </p>
    <h3><u>what worked for you?</u></h3>
    <p>
    All of the above really, However 'Flow' really matched with the way i characterised my everyday life. It was just something i had never really thought of and made me wonder if it may encourage others to be immersed and motivated by mine or others reflected behaviour..
 
  </p>
  <h3><u>which will you experiment further with?</u></h3>  
    <p>
     I believe i'll work on both my mindset and the way i approach challenges. I feel soemtimes im not always at my best and begin to let my mind wonder or day dream. Using what ive learnt i might be able to make some changes in my lifestyle..

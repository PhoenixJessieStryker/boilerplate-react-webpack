                                Looking back I remember the day full of nervous behavior, "this is it, another adventure begins", I thought to myself 
                                <br>
                                (and I was right).
                                <br>
                                I had an urge to learn and improve on the skills that we had learned throughout the kick-start for Dev Academy called Phase-0. I felt 
                                like I was bringing a lot to the table. HTML, some Javascript and hey a bit of CSS too.
                                <br>
                                But I was in for a Surprise...
                                <br>
                                On our first day, we all sat in a circle, played games and gave a little introduction to who we are. We took a nice approach in which 
                                everyone was able to act comfortably and address anything they felt concerned them.
                                <br><br>
                                Dev Academy is quite strong on Manaakitanga and becoming a family. We would soon become closer as the weeks grew longer and the topics became harder.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>"Trust the process"</strong> - During week 4 I felt myself giving up, and not just because I couldn't handle the pressure but because everything moved so fast.
                                 I felt I needed to ground the topic we had learned, before moving on to the next, and because of this, I was falling behind. I was lucky to have caught
                                  up with one of my class members who seemed to be having the same struggles.
                                <br><br>
                                Upon confronting the tutor that day the reply I got was... "trust the process and to let everything go and to continue coding in class as everything 
                                will make sense soon". I felt the anger boil up inside me that night, I had never heard something so carefree and I always had to push myself to learn
                                 in college. So why not here? 
                                <br>
                                I disliked making myself vulnerable but decided to trust in my mentors, surprisingly enough I found myself following more with our day-to-day classes 
                                and I soon even found myself being more confident.
                                <br><br>
                                EDA has a funny way of teaching which introduces both practical and theory. Above that, they care a lot about our mental and physical health so in 
                                action, there is fresh fruit and healthy eating is encouraged. They also offer  
                                <br>
                                Yoga classes twice a week and 3 times a week you have classes based on human skills.
                                <br><br>
                                Upon nearing the end of the course we launch into a group project which again tests us to the extremes of everything we have just learned. 
                                <br>
                                Working with people requires organization, planning, using every people based skill we have encountered as we pass through the stress of coming 
                                up with a working product to show to friends and family on graduation night.
                                <br><br>
                                As with everything on this course I came out feeling richer in knowledge, keen to create the next product and of course proud of what our group 
                                had achieved. We could all still look at each other and had shared plenty of laughs along the way.
                                <br><br>
                                
                                Now it's crunch time. Has this course taught me enough to actually get a job in this new field of expertise? Watch this space... 
                                <br><br>
                                <u>Before signing off, if there are three terms of advice I can make then it would be: </u>
                                <br> 
                                <strong>1) Get used to being vulnerable, nobody likes someone as stiff as a rock.</strong>
                                <br>
                                <strong>2) Enjoy yourself, have fun being with the family environment of EDA.</strong>
                                <br>
                                <strong>3) "Trust the Process"</strong>

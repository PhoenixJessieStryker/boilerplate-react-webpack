      <div class="col-4"> <h3>What is Grid based Design?</h3>
        <p>When we look at a website.. our eyes follow a pattern. You might already know what i mean.
            ..If you dont well..
          </p>
          <p><b>Let me Explain. </b><em>You see our eyes when we first look at a page quite often start from the top of the left hand side of the page. We then following this patern look left to right ,then up and down.</em>
          </p>
          <div><p>Alot of print media follow this example and use it to their advantage, which answers questions as to why the website title is always on the top of the page rather than on the sides.  </p1></div>
          <p> we see this in alot of websites but to break it down even further...</p>
          <p>Title - top  <em>Image - below the title to the left</em> <em>Text - to the right of the image</em></p>
          <p> and so fourth with possible credits to the web developer(s)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-4"><h3> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Chances are youve scrolled through a website before and readjusted the browser. During the process of readjusting the browser, you'll notice that the website begins folding down.. or parts of it will. For example the parts that begin folding down usually consist of the advertisements.. and then the least important parts of the website until ofcourse it gets to the main content of the website.</p>
      <p>You'll notice on other devices such as smartphones or tablets that the website will manually adjust to the size and compress the advertisements if need be or will show the full website as it did on your desktop or laptops broswer. </p>
      <p>nowadays it is important to have a functionality for your website where the browser can be reduce in size and the websites main contents will still be available.</p>
      
      </div>
      <div class="col-4"><h3>What is semantic structure? </h3>
        <p>As to the best of my Understanding ,Sematic structure is the Structure of the HTML code we write that can be converted and understood by both people reading your code and the browser itself. </p>
        <p>for example the ' p ' defines for a paragraph as for the same way ' H1 ' determines the size of the header or title (or possibly just something very important).</p>

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h3>
      <p>I really enjoyed the use of negative space, using the boxes also allowed me to create a pattern for written content on the page.</p>
